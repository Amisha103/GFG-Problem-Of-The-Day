Chocolate Distribution Problem

Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that -
      i. Each student gets exactly one packet.
     ii. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum and return that minimum possible difference.

Examples:

Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12], m = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing following m packets :[3, 4, 9, 7, 9].
Input: arr = [7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56], m = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum difference between maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates is 4 - 2 = 2 by choosing following m packets :[3, 2, 4].
Input: arr = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56], m = 5
Output: 55
Explanation: With 5 packets for 5 students, each student will receive one packet, so the difference is 56 - 1 = 55.
Constraints:
1 ≤ m <= arr.size ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

JAVA-


class Solution {
    public int findMinDiff(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int m) {
    Collections.sort(arr);
    int minInd = 0;
    int maxInd = m - 1;
    int ans = arr.get(maxInd) - arr.get(minInd);
    
 while(maxInd < arr.size())
 {
     ans = Math.min(ans, arr.get(maxInd) - arr.get(minInd) );
     minInd++;
     maxInd++;
 }
    
    return ans;
    
        
    }
}

PYTHON-

class Solution:

    def findMinDiff(self, arr,M):

        n = len(arr)
        arr.sort()
        minInd = 0
        maxInd = M - 1
        ans = arr[maxInd] - arr[minInd]
        while maxInd < n:
            ans = min(ans, arr[maxInd] - arr[minInd])
            maxInd = maxInd + 1
            minInd = minInd + 1
        return ans
