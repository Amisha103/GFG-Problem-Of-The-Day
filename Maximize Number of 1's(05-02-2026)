Maximize Number of 1's

Given a binary array arr[] containing only 0s and 1s and an integer k, you are allowed to flip at most k 0s to 1s. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most k times.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1], k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: By flipping the zero at index 1, we get the longest subarray from index 0 to 2 containing all 1’s.
Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: By flipping the zeroes at indices 4 and 6, we get the longest subarray from index 3 to 7 containing all 1’s.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Since the array is already having the max consecutive 1's, hence we dont need to perform any operation. Hence the answer is 2.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ k ≤ arr.size()
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1

JAVA-
class Solution {
    public int maxOnes(int arr[], int k) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    int zerocnt = 0;
    while( end < n)
    {
        if(arr[end] == 0)
        {
            zerocnt++;
        }
        while(zerocnt > k)
        {
            if(arr[start] == 0)
            {
                zerocnt--;
            }
            start++;
        }
        
        ans = Math.max(ans, end - start + 1);
        end++;
    }
    return ans;
    }
}


PYTHON-

class Solution:
    def maxOnes(self, arr, k):
        start = 0
        end = 0
        ans = 0
        zerocnt = 0
        while end < len(arr):
            if arr[end] == 0:
                zerocnt = zerocnt + 1
            while zerocnt > k:
                if arr[start] == 0:
                    zerocnt = zerocnt - 1
                start = start + 1
            ans = max(ans, end - start + 1)
            end = end + 1
        return ans
