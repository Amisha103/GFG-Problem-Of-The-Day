Find Kth Rotation

Given an increasing sorted rotated array arr[] of distinct integers. The array is right-rotated k times. Find the value of k.
Let's suppose we have an array arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 9], if we rotate it by 2 times it will look like this:
After 1st Rotation : [9, 2, 4, 6]
After 2nd Rotation : [6, 9, 2, 4]

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The given array is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The original sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. We can see that the array was rotated 1 times to the right.
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 0
Explanation: The given array is not rotated.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

JAVA-
class Solution {
    public int findKRotation(int arr[]) {
       
        for(int i = 1;i < arr.length;i++)
        {
           if(arr[i - 1] > arr[i] )
           {
               return i;
           }
        }
        return 0;
        
    }
}

PYTHON-
class Solution:
    def findKRotation(self, arr):
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:
                return i
        return 0
